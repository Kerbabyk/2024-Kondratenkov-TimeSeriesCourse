На человеке сначала закрепляют множество акселерометров и гироскопов, после чего он выполняет в помещении последовательность заранее определенных действий (активностей) в течение некоторого промежутка времени. Примерами таких активностей являются открывание/закрывание дверей, включение/выключение света, питье из чашки стоя/сидя и др. В то время как человек выполняет эти активности, датчики фиксируют его скорость и направление наклона тела. Задача дата-сайентиста заключается в том, что необходимо распознать в снятых данных все активности, которые выполнял человек.  \n","\n","Данную задачу упростим, и будем выполнять поиск только одной активности во временном ряде при условии, что у нас имеется образец этой активности. В качестве данных возьмем временной ряд показаний гироскопа, закрепленного на правом запятье руки человека, из набора данных [Opportunity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/226/opportunity+activity+recognition) и образец искомой активности, питья из чашки стоя.
